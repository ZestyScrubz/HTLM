  <h2> Here we are going to talk about the important parts of a PC. </h2>
  <p class="lMar rMar"> ***Before buying random parts, you have to make sure that each piece is compatible with each other.
    Some parts might not fit or might be too new for other parts. To ensure that you have compatible parts you can check <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/" target="_blank">pcpartpicker.com.</a>
    This site will allow you see if your parts are compatible, if there is any problems, and it will show you the price of all the parts.***</p>

      </td>

  <div id="highlight">
    <h2> Case </h2>
    <p> The case has multiple purposes, but the most obvious is to protect your system from dust, animals, liquid, etc.
      A case is also used to keep the area cool. It allows proper air circulation around the computer component which might speed up the computer.
      A case also makes it easier to assemble all the components. The case has special areas for specific components.
      A great example of the case is like your skin.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="highlight2">
    <h2> Motherboard </h2>
    <p> The motherboard is a very important part of the PC becuase with out the motherboad, the computer will not run.
      The motherboard is the backbone that allows the component to all connect together.
      It makes each part talk to each other. An example of the motherboard is like the the skeleton that connect everything together.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="highlight3">
    <h2> CPU </h2>
    <p> The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is another critical part in a PC. This chip is where the magic happens.
      The CPU is incharge of retrieving and excuting insctuction. It controls every activity on the computer.
      This part can be defined as the brain of a human. </p>
  </div>

  <div id="highlight4">
    <h2> Graphics Card/GPU </h2>
    <p> Although you can turn on a PC without a graphics card, you will not be able to see anything as nothing will show.
      It won't be able to send signal to your monitor, because there would be nothing to plug the monitor into.
      The GPU is a chip insite the graphics card that is designed to accelerate graphics rendering.
      If you are into gaming, a good graphics card will give a significant increase in performance.
      The analogy of the human body is the eyes.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="highlight5">
    <h2> RAM </h2>
    <p> RAM (Random Access Memory) is a computers short term memory. RAM gives applications a place to store and access data on a short-term basis.
      It store the information the computer is actively using so it can be accessed quickly. With that being said, the more RAM you are using, the slower your application and computer will be to process
      To better understand, lets say you want to open a document, it loads from your storage drive. Then the processor tranfers this data from long term to short term,
      so you get quicker responses, now that document is using RAM.
      Unlike the <a href="#highlight6">storage device</a>, once your computer turn off, all the data on the RAM will turn off.
      The RAM may be seen as the pre-frontal lobe in the brain. </p>
  </div>

  <div id="highlight6">
    <h2> Storage Device </h2>
    <p> A storage device is a device that stores information. I will be talking about the <b class="red">long term</b> storage system.
      The most common storage we see nowadays are the Hard Disk Drive (HDD), the Solid State Drive (SSD), and the NVMe (Nonvolatile Memory Express). And older example are floppy disk, zip disk or punched cards.
      The storage can compare to the part of the brain that remebers long term. (The hippocampus).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="highlight7">
    <h2> PSU </h2>
    <p> The PSU (Power Supply Unit) is an essential when it come to booting a PC. The PSU provides the PC and the parts power to run properly.
      A PSU has a power output rating from 200 watts to 1800 watts. However, it might not be so good to go 1800 watts as it might damage PC parts.
      A 850 watt should be the maximum you are looking for. It would be more than enough to power most PC.
      You could think of the PSU as your Digestive system. (It provides energy) </p>
  </div>

  <div id="highlight8">
    <h2> Cooling </h2>
    <p> When we talk about cooling, we talk about the CPU cooler and the Case fan.
      The CPU cooler is something that people might not think of at first, but is important. The CPU cooler prevents the computer to overheat which will
      slow down the PC and might even crash the PC. The extreme heat will damage your computer, therefore shortening the life span.
      CPU cooling can come as both air and liquid cooling.
      The fan could be defined as your sweat glands.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="highlight9">
    <h2> OS </h2>
    <p> The operating system (OS) might not be a PC part, but is a software that runs on the computer.
      The OS manages the computer's memory and processes. It allows you to communicate with your computer without knowing how to speak the computer language.
      Some popular and trust worthy OS are Windows, Linux, and macOS.
      You could think of the OS of a part of the brain that allows you to communicate.</p>
